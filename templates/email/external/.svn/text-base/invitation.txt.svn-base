The Emperor has deemed you worthy of an invitation to the ALPHA version of pantheon.

Being an ALPHA version, the game is currently a little limited. In this ALPHA version, you will be able to create your city, build buildings, research items, join/create guilds, and stockpile your troops in anticipation of the BETA version

The BETA version of Pantheon will allow you to attack your friends, and capture their cities to use for your own benefits.  As your troops return victorious from battle they will be healed, and gain experience.  Their experience will allow them to progress into Generals, Heros and eventually Legends.

The DELTA version of pantheon will introduce the caste system, and allow players to progress in the game from lowly gentlemen/ladies, to mighty Kings and Queens.  As a Kingor Queen you may even have what it takes to Capture the Emperor himself, and rule over everything how you see fit.

Pay attention to the Temples you build.  Each temple will be dedicated to a specific Diety.  Most Dieties in our Pantheon do not like each other.  Worshiping one God, may incur the wrath of another, however with enough faith, you may just be able to summon this God to walk in the mortal coil, and even fight alongside your Legends and Heroes into an Epic Battle for the ultimate right to RULE!

The email __EMAIL__ must use the invitation code __CODE__ to register in the game.

Welcome to Pantheon.
